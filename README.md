# Memory Card
## About
- Developed a Demon Slayer Memory Card Game using ReactJS and CSS Styling. The game involves the player clicking on different cards from the grid and scoring as much as possible. The grid shuffles the cards at every click. The player will have to try not to click on a card twice losing him the game. If the player picks all the cards then he wins.
